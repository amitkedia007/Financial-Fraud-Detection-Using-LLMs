# Financial Fraud Detection Using AI

Get Deeper Understanding from motivation to data collection to model training to final results you can checkout the project blogs here: https://www.amitkedia.com/project/67ce1a818013ee818192b171
## Project Overview

**Introduction:** This project utilizes machine learning, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect financial fraud. It's based on a comprehensive dataset derived from financial filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to compare and enhance AI models in identifying fraudulent financial activities.

**Objective:** The goal is to foster a collaborative platform where data scientists and researchers can develop, test, and improve AI models for detecting financial fraud.

## Dataset Description

**Source:** The dataset includes financial filings from 170 companies, split equally between those involved in fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities.

**Structure:** Each dataset entry contains details such as Central Index Key (CIK), filing year, company name, and a categorical indicator of fraud.

**Final Dataset:** Finally the dataset is out on Kaggle do check it out [here..](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitkedia/financial-statement-fraud-data/)

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps involve text cleaning, tokenization, and transforming data into machine-readable formats, ensuring balanced and fair model training.

## Model Implementation

The project encompasses a variety of models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, HAN, GPT-2, and FinBERT, selected for their NLP capabilities and potential in fraud detection.

## To Reproduce

**Codebase:** Complete code for data extraction, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is available in this repository.

**Environment:** A `requirements.txt` file is provided for setting up a consistent environment.

**Documentation:** Each script is documented with clear instructions in the `README.md`, guiding through environment setup, script execution, and result interpretation.
